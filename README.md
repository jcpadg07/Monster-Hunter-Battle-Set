# Monster-Hunter-Battle-Set(Copy from README.md in another folder)
A starter game companion app to create battle sets

This project will be focused on creating a simple platform to create armor battle sets for use in games such as Monster Hunter.

It will give users a way to create battle sets offline while not playing.

They will have the ability to view already made sets while also adding their own.

It will be a console application with a menu to view current sets, add sets, save sets, and retrieve those sets.

The application will allow the user to create only one full set at a time.

Actual set size and items available to be added will be in the instructions when the app is run.

The questions will ask for names of items to add to the set. Examples for a set are: Helmet=Farhith, Armor=Borage, Weapon=IceBlade, Shield=Hisrath, PowerTotal(of the set)=42.

You can select to view the current database or "display battle sets" from the menu after the app has started. These will also give the user more ideas to choose from if they're unfamiliar.

This is just a beginning step to building a fully functional phone app in the future!
