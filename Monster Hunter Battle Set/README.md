This project will be focused on creating a simple platform to create armor battle sets for use in games such as Monster Hunter.

It will give users a way to create battle sets offline while not playing.

They will have the ability to view already made sets while also adding their own.

It will be a console application with a menu to view current sets, add sets, save sets, and retrieve those sets.

The application will have restrictions that allow the user to create only one full set at a time.

Actual set size and items available to be added will be in the instructions when the app is run.
